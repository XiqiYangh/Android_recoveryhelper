# Android_recoveryhelper
The application is dedicated to helping patients with broken forearms take rehabilitation tests on their own at any place. In contrast with traditional rehabilitation tests, the application could help save transportation time and cost, and thus bring convenience and ease. However, this application is still under development, including building up a database for storing patients' recovery performance, time and location for taking tests as well as a more comprehensive recovery measurement.
